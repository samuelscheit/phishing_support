# [Phishing Support](https://phishing.support/)

Phishing Support is an open-source tool to help automate the analysis, reporting, and tracking of phishing emails and malicious websites. It extracts indicators (links, domains, sender headers), performs quick automated checks, and helps to takedown by reporting it to the appropriate providers.

## Goal

- Make it easy to inspect suspicious emails and websites.
- Automate repetitive abuse-reporting tasks.
- Provide a privacy-conscious, auditable record of reports and analysis.

## Features

- Parse and analyze `.eml` email files and extract useful metadata and links.
- Quick automated classification (e.g., likely phishing / probably safe).
- Helpers to report phishing websites to hosting providers, registrars, and takedown services.
- Web UI for submitting emails and URLs, and for reviewing saved reports.

## Quick demo

1. Forward a phishing email to `report@phishing.support` or upload an `.eml` file via the [web UI](https://phishing.support/).
2. Paste a suspicious website URL into the Website field and click Report.
3. The app extracts indicators, performs automated checks, and attempts to report the issue.

## Privacy note

Only submit emails or links that you are allowed to share publicly. The project is intended to help protect users and organizations - do not use it to probe private systems or to impersonate abuse inquiries.
